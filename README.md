# Unicode-ASCII-Character-Detector

**A Unicode-ASCII character detector is a tool or algorithm designed to identify whether a given text string contains Unicode or ASCII characters.** This is useful in contexts where it's important to know the encoding format of the text, such as when processing data from different languages or systems that may use different character sets. The tool can help ensure that text is correctly interpreted and displayed across various platforms and applications.
